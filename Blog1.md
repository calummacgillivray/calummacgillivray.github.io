# The First Post
**Date:** 28/07/2025
**Post Number:** 1

I have added a new blog section to my website. The idea behind this is to have a place where I can write about some of the short-form thoughts I have been having around my research, or other related things. Things that I think are interesting but which I may not otherwise have had an outlet for. It will also be hand to be able to have a link to share these blog posts.

This first post mostly serves as a template for future posts. I am still fairly new to buidling a website, and it is handy to have a means of testing the blog system before I make future posts. It is also very helpful to have a fully replicable process that I can use for all future posts. I will likely improve this process in the future, but for now this works!

If you have made it here, thanks for reading and for proving the system works. I'm looking forward to posting here again soon!
